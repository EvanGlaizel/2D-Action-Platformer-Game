A school project where I went well above and beyond the requirements to turned it into a passion project of mine. It can not be compiled as I don't have distribution rights to the images, audio, font, and two DLL files. However, source files are attached to show the code written for the project.

Created in Monogame using C# and visual studio with an emphasis on object orientedÂ programming.
